# com.zanderwohl.Generator
Contains generators that create new terrain. Generators must inherit from the Generator abstract superclass, which
primarily contains the eval(int x, int y, int z) method that takes in a Volume location and creates a new volume, which
must be generated totally independent of the others.

They do not need to be complete, and context-dependant generation
can be completed later, when the populate() method is called, which is only called when all the surrounding Volumes have
also been generated, and will always be called before the user enters them.

## Simplex

A basic terrain where the height is taken from a 2D Simplex.

## Sine

A basic terrain where the x height is generated by the sine function, and the z height is generated by the tangent
function.

## Chaos

This is just a way to get all the existing blocks into the world.

## Layers

A more complicated Simplex generator based on several layers. Highly configurable.
