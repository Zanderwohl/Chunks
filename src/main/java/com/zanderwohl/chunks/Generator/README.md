# com.zanderwohl.chunks.Generator
Contains generators that create new terrain. Generators must inherit from the Generator abstract superclass, which
primarily contains the eval(int x, int y, int z) method that takes in a Volume location and creates a new volume, which
must be generated totally independent of the others.

They do not need to be complete, and context-dependant generation
can be completed later, when the populate() method is called, which is only called when all the surrounding Volumes have
also been generated, and will always be called before the user enters them.

Each generator should must also provide a ground(int x, int z) method. This returns only where the ground level would be
as an integer, without details. This way, the output from this method can be combined with other terrain generators to
make more complex terrain.

## Simplex

A basic terrain where the height is taken from a 2D Simplex.

## Sine

A basic terrain where the x height is generated by the sine function, and the z height is generated by the tangent
function.

## Chaos

This is just a way to get all the existing blocks into the world. Makes a solid layer of diagonal stripes of each block.

## Layers

A more complicated generator that takes multiple layers and stack them on top of each other.
